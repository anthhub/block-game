# Block Dodge Game

A fun dodge game inspired by blockchain, where blocks are generated by real-time Ethereum transactions!

## Game Background

Block Dodge Game combines blockchain technology with classic dodge gameplay. Players face blocks dynamically generated by real Ethereum transactions in a challenging virtual world, experiencing the unique fun brought by blockchain technology.

### Inspiration

With the rise of blockchain technology, we hope to introduce more people to the dynamic characteristics of blockchain through gaming. Each block is not just an obstacle but an ongoing transaction, adding unpredictable challenges to the game.

### Design Philosophy

In this game, players not only survive by dodging blocks but also experience the complexity and variability of the blockchain world. The falling speed and size of each block are related to the nature of the transaction, requiring quick reactions and strategic movement.

## Gameplay

### Basic Controls
- **Left Arrow / A**: Move left
- **Right Arrow / D**: Move right
- **Space / Up Arrow / W**: Jump
- **Continuous Jumping**: Can jump again immediately after landing
- **Mid-air Control**: Can still move left or right during a jump to adjust position

### Game Mechanics
1. **Dodge Blocks**:
   - Avoid falling blocks, each representing a real-time Ethereum transaction.
   - Block size is determined by the transaction amount.
   - Block color reflects transaction status and type (e.g., regular transaction, smart contract call).
   - Successfully dodging blocks automatically scores points.

2. **Block Confirmation and Disappearance**:
   - Blocks disappear once the transaction is fully confirmed on the blockchain.
   - A black hole effect is created upon disappearance, temporarily attracting nearby small blocks.

3. **Block Info Box**:
   - Displays detailed transaction information when the player is near a block.
   - Information includes: transaction amount, sender address, receiver address, transaction hash, etc.

4. **Black Hole Effect**:
   - Affects player movement when blocks disappear, requiring quick adjustment to avoid being sucked in.

5. **Scoring System**:
   - Base score: 1 point for each successfully dodged block.
   - Consecutive Dodging: Quickly dodging multiple blocks earns higher scores.
   - High Score Record: The game records and displays your highest score.

6. **Life System**:
   - Starts with 2 lives.

7. **Power-Up Usage**:
   - Prioritize acquiring power-ups that are most helpful in the current situation.
   - Find a safe spot before the power-up effect ends.
   - Avoid risky areas for power-ups.

8. **Network State Influence**:
   - The level of network congestion affects game difficulty, such as changing gravity or block spawn speed.

### Block Generation Logic

1. **Block Update**:
   - Each block calls the `update` method to refresh its state.
   - If a block is not confirmed and the time since the last status update exceeds a preset interval, its transaction status is updated.

2. **Block Cleanup**:
   - Check and clean up confirmed blocks: if a transaction is confirmed and the block has not started fading out, trigger an explosion effect.
   - Remove blocks from the physical world if they are fully faded out or off-screen.

3. **New Block Generation**:
   - Determine whether to generate a new block based on the time interval since the last generation and the length of the transaction buffer.
   - Randomly select a transaction from the buffer, create a new block instance, and add it to the game.
   - Update the last generation time and calculate the next block generation interval.

4. **Network State Update**:
   - Periodically update the network state to influence the overall game dynamics.

5. **Buffer Management**:
   - Maintain the transaction buffer size within a preset limit.
   - Periodically clear the confirmed transaction set.
