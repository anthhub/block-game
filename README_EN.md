# Block Dodge Game

## Introduction

A fun dodge game inspired by blockchain, where blocks are generated by real-time Ethereum transactions!

## Game Background

Block Dodge Game combines blockchain technology with classic dodge gameplay. Players face blocks dynamically generated by real Ethereum transactions in a challenging virtual world, experiencing the unique fun brought by blockchain technology.

### Inspiration

With the rise of blockchain technology, we hope to introduce more people to the dynamic characteristics of blockchain through gaming. Each block is not just an obstacle but an ongoing transaction, adding unpredictable challenges to the game.

### Design Philosophy

In this game, players not only survive by dodging blocks but also experience the complexity and variability of the blockchain world. The falling speed and size of each block are related to the nature of the transaction, requiring quick reactions and strategic movement.

## Gameplay

### Basic Controls
- **Left Arrow / A**: Move left
- **Right Arrow / D**: Move right
- **Space / Up Arrow / W**: Jump
- **Continuous Jumping**: Can jump again immediately after landing
- **Mid-air Control**: Can still move left or right during a jump to adjust position

### Game Mechanics
1. **Dodge Blocks**:
   - Avoid falling blocks, each representing a real-time Ethereum transaction.
   - Block size is determined by the transaction amount.
   - Block color reflects transaction status and type (e.g., regular transaction, smart contract call).
   - Successfully dodging blocks automatically scores points.

2. **Block Confirmation and Disappearance**:
   - Blocks disappear once the transaction is fully confirmed on the blockchain.
   - A black hole effect is created upon disappearance, temporarily attracting nearby small blocks.

3. **Block Info Box**:
   - Displays detailed transaction information when the player is near a block.
   - Information includes: transaction amount, sender address, receiver address, transaction hash, etc.

4. **Black Hole Effect**:
   - Affects player movement when blocks disappear, requiring quick adjustment to avoid being sucked in.

5. **Scoring System**:
   - Base score: 1 point for each successfully dodged block.
   - Consecutive Dodging: Quickly dodging multiple blocks earns higher scores.
   - High Score Record: The game records and displays your highest score.

6. **Life System**:
   - Starts with 2 lives.

7. **Power-Up Usage**:
   - Prioritize acquiring power-ups that are most helpful in the current situation.
   - Find a safe spot before the power-up effect ends.
   - Avoid risky areas for power-ups.

8. **Network State Influence**:
   - The level of network congestion affects game difficulty, such as changing gravity or block spawn speed.

### Block Generation Logic

1. **Block Update**:
   - Each block calls the `update` method to refresh its state.
   - If a block is not confirmed and the time since the last state update exceeds a preset interval, its transaction status is updated.

2. **Block Cleanup**:
   - Check and clean up confirmed blocks: If a transaction is confirmed and the block has not started fading out, trigger an explosion effect.
   - Remove blocks from the physical world if they are completely faded out or off-screen.

3. **Generate New Blocks**:
   - Decide whether to generate new blocks based on the interval since the last generation and the length of the transaction buffer.
   - Randomly select a transaction from the buffer, create a new block instance, and add it to the game.
   - Update the last generation time and calculate the interval for the next block generation.

4. **Network State Update**:
   - Regularly update the network state to influence the overall game dynamics.

5. **Buffer Management**:
   - Maintain the transaction buffer size within preset limits.
   - Regularly clean up confirmed transactions.

### Player Update Mechanism
- **Ground Check**: Ensures the player does not fall below the ground level and resets jumping status when on the ground.
- **Downward Acceleration**: Increases the falling speed if the down key is pressed while falling.
- **Screen Boundaries**: Keeps the player within the horizontal bounds of the screen.
- **Invincibility Blink**: Implements a blinking effect when the player is invincible.

### Blockchain Phenomena Simulation
- **Transaction Confirmation**: The disappearance of blocks simulates the transaction confirmation process. Once confirmed, blocks disappear and create a black hole effect, symbolizing the completion of the transaction and the redistribution of resources.
- **Network Congestion**: The frequency and speed of block generation are affected by network congestion, simulating the performance of the blockchain network under high load.
- **Transaction Types**: Different colored blocks represent different types of transactions, such as regular transfers and smart contract calls, helping players understand the diversity of blockchain transactions.
- **Miner Fees**: The size and color of blocks are also influenced by miner fees. Higher fees result in larger and darker blocks, representing the impact of fees on transaction speed and cost.
- **Block Size**: The size of blocks in the game is also affected by the actual block size. Larger actual blocks result in larger game blocks, representing the impact of block size on transaction processing speed.

### User Interface
- **HUD Display**: Shows current score, lives, and network status at the top of the game interface.
- **Transaction Details**: Display detailed transaction information when clicking on or approaching a block.
- **Pause Menu**: Press `Esc` to pause the game and display the options menu.

## Game Tips

### Beginner Tips
1. **Basic Movement**:
   - Keep the character moving, don't stand still.
   - Use short jumps to dodge low blocks.
   - Plan the next jump before landing.

2. **Spatial Awareness**:
   - Pay attention to the size and speed of falling blocks.
   - Anticipate where blocks will land and avoid them in advance.
   - Stay in the central area of the screen for easier movement.

3. **Power-Up Usage**:
   - Prioritize acquiring power-ups that are most helpful in the current situation.
   - Find a safe spot before the power-up effect ends.
   - Avoid risky areas for power-ups.

### Advanced Tips
1. **Continuous Movement**:
   - Skillfully combine jumping and lateral movement.
   - Plan the landing route while in the air.
   - Use short jumps to quickly adjust position.

2. **Rhythm Control**:
   - Observe the pattern and interval of block generation.
   - Adjust game strategy based on network congestion.
   - Stay calm in dense areas, don't panic.

3. **High Score Techniques**:
   - Prioritize dodging large blocks, which usually represent large transactions.
   - Use power-ups wisely to create scoring opportunities.
   - Stay alert during network congestion for more scoring opportunities.

### Advanced Strategies
- **Utilize Network Information**: By observing the network congestion indicator, anticipate the density of block generation and adjust your movement strategy accordingly.
- **Combine Power-Ups**: During power-up effects, try to combine different power-up effects to maximize survival time and score.
- **Mental Preparation**: Stay calm, especially in high-difficulty stages, as excessive tension can lead to mistakes.

## Performance Optimization
